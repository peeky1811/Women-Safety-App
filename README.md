# Women-Safety-App

This is an application for the safety of women in daily life. It is a simple app that alerts their closed ones whenever they are in danger at the touch of a button. It also has an added functionality that lets their loved ones know they are safe and not to worry about their where abouts.
This app has 2 buttons. A DANGER button and a SAFETY button. You can set the emergency contacts and a specially curated message will be sent to them. There is also an option for changing the message and that will be sent whenever you press the button nex time onwards.
The buttons are given because when we are in danger, our brain may not work well. But we are accustomed to pressing buttons when we see one which is the basis of this app.

#It is under development.
